    This ``CamSettingComboBox`` class allows for selecting the value of
    one sensitivity category (described by its index in the list
    "Sensitivity Categories"). If the user changes the value of the
    ``CamSettingComboBox``, the entries of the lower levels of
    sensitivity categories (potentially) need to be adapted. Therefore,
    this ``CamSettingComboBox`` holds the ``CamSettingComboBoxDict``
    ``cam_combos``, which is a ``CamSettingComboBoxDict`` with
    references to the ``CamSettingComboBox``'s of all sensitivity
    category indices. This way the changed ``CamSettingComboBox`` can
    trigger the next-level ``CamSettingComboBox`` to adapt its options.
